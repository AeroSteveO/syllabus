# Makeup Queue

You will create a C++ program that will simulate the scheduling and time it takes to apply makeup to actors when there is only one person in charge of applying makeups. 
Scheduling of processes in an operating system to simulate multitasking when there is only one processor based on threads is done similarly.
The fundamental data structure will be array-based lists.

## Input 

The input is a plan-text file, where each line is terminated with an end-of-line character.
Each line will identify the time of arrival of an actor or actress as well as the duration to apply his or her make up.
To simplify we can assume that the time and duration are given in minutes, where the initial time is 0 minutes.
Lines in the input file that start with the symbol `#` should be considered comments and skipped.
